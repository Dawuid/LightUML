    <h1>Introduction to LightUML</h1>
	<p>
		LightUML is a lightweight alternative for generating UML class diagrams in Eclipse.
		A class diagram can be generated from a Java project or a Java package (which may
		contain other packages).
	</p>
	<p>
		LightUML uses UmlGraph doclet (by Diomidis Spinellis) to generate a .dot file out of
		a Java project or package. After that (AT&T) GraphViz 'dot' tool is used to convert the 
		.dot file to graphics form of choice. And lastly, the graphics file is added to the 
		Java project.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a prerequisite, you need to have <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a> installed. 
		You also need to get a <a href="http://www.spinellis.gr/sw/umlgraph/">UmlGraph</a>
		jar-package. 
	</p>
	<p>
		LightUML also aims to support UMLGraph sequence diagrams. This part is
		still under construction but a prerequisite for generating sequence diagrams
		is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/">
	  	plotutils package</a>.
